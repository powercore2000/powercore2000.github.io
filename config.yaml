     Hello! I'm Corvalis Cohen, a software engineer, and founder of Silvaroc Studios L.L.C. I work in a self employed capacity while pursuing my undergraduate Computer Science degree. Currently looking for work to both finance my education and gain more applied experience in the work force. 

     My current expertise consists of 5+ years of software development experience from hobbyist projects, freelance software work, Unity virtual production, game development, and full stack web development. I also have experience in Development Operations for game and web development environments. 

     I possess excellent communication, coordination, and cooperation skills from my years of community work with the Young Male Scholars foundation and Women's Leadership Project. Along with superb administrative and documentation skills from the years of maintaining documentation from my projects, handling my business's administrative needs, handling the production of several long-term projects and collaborating with contractors and volunteers.

     I'm looking for a wide variety of remote assignments I can take while pursing my degree. My preferred fields of work are those in software engineering, development operations, and other technical positions with my current qualifications. I always looking forward to further job training, learning new technologies as I work, gain new experiences, and working with teams of a variety people. I look forward to working with you!
